CISC 472 Assignment 3
Due March 26, 2021 at 18:00

In this assignment, you will calibrate a tracked stylus using the
sphere-fitting method described in the notes on Least-Squares Problems.

Three sets of points are provided.  These were collected in a
calibration procedure using the NDI Polaris system.  The stylus tip
was placed in a divot and the stylus moved around in the hemisphere
over the divot.

The files are

  pivot_calibration_0.csv
  pivot_calibration_1.csv
  pivot_calibration_2.csv

In Matlab, starting with the skeleton code provided:

1. Implement a pivot calibration method using 'fitSphere' and other
   code to determine the best-fit vector to the stylus tip in the
   stylus's *local* coordinate system.

2. Implement a RANSAC variant of 'fitSphere' called 'fitSphereWithRANSAC'.

3. For each calibration set: determine the best-fit local vector using
   'fitSphere' and 'fitSphereWithRANSAC'.  Record the best-fit vector
   and the standard deviation of the best-fit vector using each method.

4. For each calibration set: *Render* the best-fit vectors, along with
   the ellipsoid of the 95% confidence interval.  Record the rendered
   images.  To render, you'll need to get the principal axes of the
   cloud of best-fit vectors; you can use 'eig' and 'cov' in Matlab
   for this.  Then the 95% CI on each axis is 1.96*sqrt(eigenvalue)
   for that axis.

5. Answer these questions:

   5a. What characterizes a good calibration set?  Justify based on your
       results.
   
   5b. What method (sphere or sphere-with-ransac) was best for handling
       each calibration set?  Is it always the same method, or do
       different characteristics of the set deserve different methods?
       Justify your answer.

   5c. What recommendations do you have for pivot calibration?

To hand in

  Create a directory called 'a3'.  In that directory, put *exactly* these files:

      a3.m                          your working code

      calibration_0.png             your rendered image of pivot_calibration_0.csv
      calibration_0_ransac.png      your rendered image of pivot_calibration_0.csv using RANSAC
      calibration_1.png
      calibration_1_ransac.png
      calibration_2.png
      calibration_2_ransac.png
      calibration_3.png
      calibration_3_ransac.png

      README.txt

   The README.txt file should contain your name(s) and netid(s), along
   with your answers to #5 above and your best-fit vectors and their
   standard deviation from #3 for each calibration set.

   Zip the a3 directory and submit it on OnQ.
